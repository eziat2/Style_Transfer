# Business Use Cases

## Commercial art
    From poetry to artwork to music, we’ve only just entered the era of AI creations. And style transfer is one of the computer vision techniques making this wave of AI-powered artwork possible.
    
## Photo and video editors
    One of the most clear applications of style transfer is in photo and video editing software

## Gaming
    At a press conference during the 2019 Game Developers Conference, Google introduced Stadia, it’s cloud-powered video game streaming service. And one of the primary features included in that demo was an in-game style transfer feature that automatically recomposes the virtual world with textures and color palettes from a potentially limitless range of art styles.

## Virtual reality
    While the applications with style transfer in VR are still largely in the research phase, the possibilities are exciting and promising. Facebook touts the potential of style transfer to radically alter the ways VR developers tell visual stories through their applications, games, films, and more.
