# Possible Business Use Cases
1) Commercial art -  From poetry to artwork to music. (eg. https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx)
2) Photo and video editors - One of the most clear applications of style transfer is in photo and video editing software
3) Gaming - At a press conference during the 2019 Game Developers Conference, Google introduced Stadia, itâ€™s cloud-powered video game streaming service. And one of the primary features included in that demo was an in-game style transfer feature that automatically recomposes the virtual world with textures and color palettes from a potentially limitless range of art styles.
4) Virtual reality - While the applications with style transfer in VR are still largely in the research phase, the possibilities are exciting and promising. Facebook touts the potential of style transfer to radically alter the ways VR developers tell visual stories through their applications, games, films, and more.
